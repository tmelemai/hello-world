An introduction to this whole GitHub thing

Hello World!

Wow, where to start? My name is Terrance Melemai and I am going to be a great programmer some day. Some day soon, hopefully!
I got my degree in Electrical Engineering and all through school I had a penchant for coding. Now that I am out in the real
world, I am looking to turn my interest, turned passion, into a profession.

On that note, after a brief introduction I have one thing left to say. Hello World, now look out!
